# StrengthLog üí™

**StrengthLog** is a user-friendly iOS application designed to help you meticulously track your strength training workouts, monitor your progress, and achieve your fitness goals. Built with SwiftUI and SwiftData, it offers a clean interface and powerful features for a seamless logging experience.
